* TODO [1/4]
- [X] Small stuff [2/2]
  - [X] remove SWIG examples
  - [X] RP: Update doc/continuous-integration.md - is it still up to date?
    
- [ ] Class diagrams [0/2]
  - [ ] Which classes are there in OOMMF
  - [ ] what should joommf look like?

- [ ] Examples [0/1]
  - [ ] Write python file for each example (of course we have tests)

- [-] Basic functionality [1/3]
  - [ ] read magnetisation from a file
  - [X] save magnetisation to a file
  - [ ] read/write arbirtray fields from an oommf run

- [ ] Arbitrary Vector Fields
  - [ ] Can call Python from an arbitrary Tcl proc, so in theory can get more clever with
        the integration and allow non-Tcl scripts to run.
  - [ ] Otherwise, many examples of functions that already exist in examples - grep for 'Oxs_ScriptVectorField'

- [ ] Alternative meshes
  - [ ] grep for variations on '*Atlas:' to find various examples e.g elipsoid
  - [ ] Along with this need to write code to support having different material 
        parameters in different regions.
